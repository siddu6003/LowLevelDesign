if class B is subtype of class A then we should be able to replace object A with B without braking the behaviour
subclass should extend the capability of parent class

Bike object which is motorcycle assume it is calling turnOnEngine it will do since motorcycle has an engine
but when bicycle object is passed then it is throwing an error and braking the code because of exception
